- If you save a .world file it will save the turtlebot with it. This is bad because the .launch files already places a turtlebot and
    weird physics will result (ice skating turtlebot!)
    To fix this modify the .world file directly and remove all the lines between
    "<model name='mobile_base'>"
    and its corresponding
    "</model>"
    as well as the second instance of the lines down near the bottom of the file.
    You will end up removing around 1000 lines.
    To avoid this completely you can also save the world after deleting the turtlebot.

- To avoid resetting the world manually use the command "rosservice call /gazebo/reset_world"
